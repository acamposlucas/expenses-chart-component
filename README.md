## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This is my second React project so I'm learning it step by step. In this project I used [miragejs](https://miragejs.com/) to create a fake backend to consume the data from JSON file. I want to add it dinamically into the components.
I also improved my knowledge on TypeScript with interfaces and typing.
And of course I also practiced and learned a lot about [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), sending Props to styled-components to calculate bar heights and also manipulating other elements within an element.

### Useful resources

- [Como criar um tooltip animado...]](https://medium.com/@eduardoqgomes/como-criar-um-tooltip-animado-em-reactjs-com-styled-components-3a75c29db69c) - This taught me how to change properties on different styled-component while making actions in a certain component. I needed it so I could make the hover and click effect on the buttons. Funny how styled-component just solved a problem I was trying to solve with JavaScript. This is a powerfull tool!
